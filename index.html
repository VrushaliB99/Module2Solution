		<b>PIZZA:-------</b>	
		Pizza is a type of food that was created in Italy. It is made by putting "toppings" (such as cheese, sausages, pepperoni, vegetables, tomatoes, spices and herbs and basil and fries) over a piece of bread covered with sauce. The sauce is most often tomato-based, but sometimes butter-based sauces are used.
	</p></div>

	<div class="col-lg-3 col-md-6"><p>
		<b>BURGER:-------</b>
		The term "burger" can also be applied to the meat patty on its own, especially in the United Kingdom, where the term "patty" is rarely used, or the term can even refer simply to ground beef. Since the term hamburger usually implies beef, for clarity "burger" may be prefixed with the type of meat or meat substitute used, as in beef burger, turkey burger, bison burger, or veggie burger.

	<div class="col-lg-3 col-md-6"><p>
		<b>COLD COFFEE:-------</b>
		Iced coffee is a type of coffee beverage served chilled, brewed variously with the fundamental division being cold brew – brewing the coffee cold, yielding a different flavor, and not requiring cooling – or brewing normally (hot) and then cooling, generally by simply pouring over ice or into ice cold milk.
